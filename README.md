LINEAR SEARCH: PYTHON
Review
You are a linear search whiz!

You have implemented linear search as a function in Python and used it to find a target value, duplicates, and the largest value in different search lists.

Letâ€™s review what we learned:

Linear search is a search algorithm that sequentially checks whether a given value is an element of specified list by scanning the elements of a list one-by-one until it finds the target value.

Starting with linear search as a subroutine in your code is a useful foundation for constructing algorithms to solve more advanced search problems, such as:

Finding duplicates - sequentially search the list for all occurrences of the target value.

Finding the maximum value - sequentially scan the list for the largest value and track the largest value seen to date.

The linear_search() function is provided in the text editor.

Test on your own examples!
